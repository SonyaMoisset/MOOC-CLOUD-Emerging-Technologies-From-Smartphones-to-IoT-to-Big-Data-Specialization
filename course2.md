# Emerging Technologies: From Smartphones to IoT to Big Data Specialization
## Big Data, Cloud Computing, & CDN Emerging Technologies
### About the Course:
You have most likely heard about Clouds and Big Data before, and already know how significantly important they are and will be in the future.

Cloud Computing enables us to easily use software as well as processing platforms and computing infrastructure (that are not equipped on our computers and smartphones) from any location through Internet services. Big Data provides us with new intelligence from massive data sets, which can help in situation/condition/status analysis and decision making. In addition, CDN is the best technology to provide information/contents to Internet users in the quickest and most efficient way. Therefore, the information/software/database/contents from Clouds and Big Data centers can be very effectively supported by CDNs. This is why these lectures are combined together in this course.

#### Week 1 
##### Cloud Computing
These lectures focus on the major features and functionalities of Cloud Computing. The lectures start with first answering the question “What does Cloud Computing do?” and then provide Cloud Computing Application Examples, and then provide description on the Cloud Models IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service), as well as VM (Virtual Machine). Next, the lecture covers Cloud Services based on examples of the Google Cloud, Amazon Cloud, and the iCloud.

#### Week 2
##### Big Data
These lectures focus on the features and architecture of Big Data. The lectures start with providing Big Data examples, which include the past event of the H1N1 flu virus spread prevention, smartphone marketing, and industrial examples of Big Data in use by Wal-Mart, Amazon.com, and Citibank. To explain the major technical challenges of Big Data, the influence of data Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity are discussed. Then, to provide a realistic overview of a reliable shared storage Big Data analysis system, the architecture of Hadoop is described. The description includes details on MapReduce and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed FileSystem), which are the two major components of Hadoop.

#### Week 3
##### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
Everybody using smartphones, PCs, and the Internet have already been using CDN (Content Delivery Network) services, and will continue to use CDN services for their entire life. Obviously, CDN technology is very important. These lectures focus on the market, services, features, operations, and architecture of CDN technology. The lectures start with CDN Motivation and Structure, then the lecture provides details on CDN Procedures and Hierarchical Content Delivery Models. Next, the CDN Market and Major Service Providers are introduced followed by CDN Research & Development topics.
